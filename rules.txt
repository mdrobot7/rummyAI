Rules of Rummy (2 player):
- Standard 52 card deck, NO jokers. Add more decks if playing with more than 2 people.
- Each person is dealt 10 cards
- The remaining cards are placed in the middle, and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.
- The non-dealer goes first

GOAL
- Get rid of all 10 cards in your hand before the other player does.
- See scoring.

PLAY
- When you begin your turn, you must pick up a card, either from the top of the deck or the face-up card on top of the discard pile.
- You can meld or lay off any cards you wish, whenever you wish during your turn. See below for rules.
- You end your turn by discarding one card of your choice on the top of the discard pile.

Types of Melds:
- Straights/Runs (3 cards or longer, of the same suit, in numerical order).
  - Runs DO NOT WRAP! (no Queen, King, Ace, 2 runs)
  - Ace is at the BOTTOM
- Same card (3 or more cards of the same type, Ace, King, 2, etc)

Laying off rules:
- Once cards are melded by either player, they are placed on the table and belong to nobody.
- Anybody can lay off cards at any time.
- Cards can be added to either end of a run (provided they are the same suit and in order), or to a same card set.

SCORING
- When one of the players has gotten rid of all of the cards in their hand, the round ends.
- The cards of the losing player's hand are added up as below:
  - Number cards get their face value
  - Face cards get 10 points regardless.
  - Ace is 1pt.
- The winning player is awarded that amount of points.

Going Rummy (similar to Shooting the Moon)
- If a player gets rid of all 10 cards in one turn, they "go rummy"
- The points they earn are doubled.

GAME END:
- The game ends when a player reaches 100pts.
